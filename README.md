Project was developed locally without collaboration. Has been tested on on 2 different images. Results will vary depending on image clarity. If background is an independent colour compared to cells output should be good.

Adjust image using sliders on the left and convert the image to red, blue and white image. Analysis of total cells and clusters can then be carried out using the functions provided.
